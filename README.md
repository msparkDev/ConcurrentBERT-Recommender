# Enhancing E-commerce Recommendation Systems with Concurrent Purchase Data: A Transformer-Based Approach

Authors: Minseo Park, Jangmin Oh*

## Our Novel Contributions are:

1. **Integration of Concurrent Purchase Data:** We pioneer the integration of concurrent purchase data into e-commerce recommendation systems, utilizing this novel approach to capture complex consumer purchasing patterns and enhance predictive accuracy.
2. **Transformer-Based Recommendation Algorithm:** Leveraging the BERT model, we develop a transformer-based recommendation algorithm fine-tuned for next-product prediction in e-commerce, showcasing a significant advancement over traditional recommendation systems.
3. **Validation on Real-World Data:** Our methodology is validated on real-world data from *Katcher's* e-commerce platform, demonstrating superior performance in accurately predicting future purchases and setting a new benchmark for recommendation system efficacy.
