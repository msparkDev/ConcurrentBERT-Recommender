# Enhancing E-commerce Recommendation Systems with Concurrent Purchase Data: A Transformer-Based Approach

Authors: Minseo Park, Jangmin Oh*

## Our Novel Contributions are:

1. **Integration of Concurrent Purchase Data:** We pioneer the integration of concurrent purchase data into e-commerce recommendation systems, utilizing this novel approach to capture complex consumer purchasing patterns and enhance predictive accuracy.
2. **Transformer-Based Recommendation Algorithm:** Leveraging the BERT model, we develop a transformer-based recommendation algorithm fine-tuned for next-product prediction in e-commerce, showcasing a significant advancement over traditional recommendation systems.
3. **Validation on Real-World Data:** Our methodology is validated on real-world data from *Katcher's* e-commerce platform, demonstrating superior performance in accurately predicting future purchases and setting a new benchmark for recommendation system efficacy.

## Dependencies

To get started with the framework, install the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.10**

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data

Due to the proprietary nature of the dataset from Katcher's, we are unable to publicly disclose or share the company's private data. We understand the importance of privacy and confidentiality in handling such information.

As an alternative for demonstration and reproducibility purposes, we have organized our code to work with an open-source dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset can serve as a proxy to understand the methodologies applied in our project:

- **Open-Source Dataset:** [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This dataset is utilized to illustrate the application of our algorithms and framework without compromising the privacy of the proprietary data.
