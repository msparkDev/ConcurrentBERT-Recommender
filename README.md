A workflow that recommends products that the user is likely to purchase next. Because our method handles the user's concurrent purchases, it better analyzes the user's more complex patterns and shows higher performance than other methods.

### Our novel contributions are:
1. Developed a unique system to **integrate concurrent purchase data into e-commerce recommendation models,** enhancing understanding of complex buying patterns.
2. Applied the BERT transformer model to analyze e-commerce order histories as natural language, capturing deeper product relationships.
3. Demonstrated through real-world data that **our approach significantly outperforms traditional recommendation systems** in accuracy and predictive performance.
